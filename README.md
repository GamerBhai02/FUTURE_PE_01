## 🧠 Prompt Engineering Approach

A **prompt chain** was designed to break the task into structured steps, ensuring clarity and consistency.

Prompt 3 → Full Script Generation
Prompt 4 → Thumbnail Concept
```


Each prompt builds upon the output of the previous prompt to maintain narrative alignment across all deliverables.
